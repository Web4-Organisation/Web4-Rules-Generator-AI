# **App Name**: Guildelines AI

## Core Features:

- AI Rule Generation: Rule Template Generation: Uses the Gemini API to generate draft community rule sets based on community type tags (e.g., 'Gaming', 'Professional', 'Family Friendly'). Offers both predefined tags and an 'inspire me' option, acting as a smart tool for reasoned decisions about appropriate rules.
- Community Tagging: Tag Selection: Allows administrators to select or input tags that define their community type, influencing the generated rule set.
- Rule Editor: Rule Customization: Enables administrators to review, edit, and customize the AI-generated rule set before implementation.
- GitHub Ready: Markdown Export: Generates a detailed README.md file containing the community rules and setup instructions, formatted for GitHub.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pastel purple (#D8B4FE), inspired by a modern design for digital communities.
- Background color: Very light pastel orange (#FDE68A), offering a gentle but engaging contrast to the primary purple.
- Accent color: Light lavender (#C4B5FD), creating depth through the interplay with the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, neutral appearance appropriate to both headings and body text.
- Clean and intuitive layout, with clear sections for tag selection, rule display, and editing options.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when generating and customizing rules.
- Use simple and relevant icons to represent different community types and rule categories.
